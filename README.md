<br>

### Usage
1. Run the ff code to start the game:

2. Prevent the ball from falling to the ground by moving your platform whilst hitting all the blocks. As you progress, the number of blocks increase
the ball's speed increases, and the platform's speed decreases. Try to get the highest possible score in this endless game of pong
3. Controls:
    * *Left Arrow Key:* Move the platform to the left
